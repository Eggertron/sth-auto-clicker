This is based on a video that code bullet made.

The scipt will auto click on the soldiers as the appear from the left
of the screen. A region must be selected first to focus the CV processing.
You will still need to press the <space bar> to manually load the bullets.
There is a sleep time between each bullet fire because the clicks cannot
process at the speed given.

this requires:
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install Pillow
python -m pip install opencv-python
python -m pip install pywin32
